We as a team would work using TDD (Test Driven Development) in order to reach 3 specific iterations in order to complete the overall goal of finishing this project. Below shows our development cycle and how many significant changes we commited to each iteration.

Over the process of 12 weeks, we worked as a team of developers using TDD. Alongside our code are test cases which shows both our approach to this project as well as style of implementation.

- Iteration 1 Releases: 37
- Iteration 2 Releases: 46
- Iteration 3 Releases: 39
- Total Releases: 122
